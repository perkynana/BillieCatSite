        <p>Hey there, I'm <b style="font-size: 20px;">Billie</b>, thanks for stopping by and taking the
            time to get to know a little about me.<br><br>
            I started out in life as an SPCA special, until one day in January 2017, 2 amazing humans
            stopped and stared at me through the glass pane of my, what I like to call, <em>box from hell</em>.
            It's OK, I wasn’t alone, I was accompanied by my sister, who at the time was a lot more energetic
            than I, and
            far more attention seeking than what was needed! <br><br>
            However, that didn’t stop these folk taking a liking to me and asking to have a hold to size me up!
            <br><br>
            I didn’t have much to offer in terms of excitement at the time, in fact I was feeling pretty <em>meh</em>
            on this day and after a few minutes with me, they decided to put me back. I wasn't sure if they were
            interested anymore but lo and behold, I was placed on hold. Rumour has it they took a liking, but were
            concerned about my well being, so they asked if they could come back to check on me later that day.
            <br><br>
            I didn’t think they would come back to visit me, but just before the doors were about to close (talking
            about leaving it to the last minute here), there they stood! They reached in and started to check on me.
            Again, much like earlier in the day, I was still not 100%. After being checked over by the vet, I was taken
            away a put in isolation.<br><br>
            Days went by, and no one came to see me, I thought that that was it, I was going to be all by myself from
            here
            on out. What I didn't know though, was that the 2 awesome peeps I mentioned earlier, had already agreed to
            take me home, once I was well enough to leave. <br>
